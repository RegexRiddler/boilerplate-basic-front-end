# Basic Front-End Boilerplate
## A boilerplate for small projects using HTML, CSS, and Javascript
This lightweight boilerplate uses Yarn for package management but there is no reason why you can't use NPM. Gulp is used for running tasks like watching files, transpiling sass, running local server, and building the project.
